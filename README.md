### Installation üëÄ

1. Download the newest [release](https://github.com/swiftly-solution/admins/releases) of Admins - Core.
2. Download the newest [release](https://github.com/swiftly-solution/admins_basebans/releases) of Admins - Base Bans.
3. Everything is drag & drop, so I think you can do it!
4. Setup database connection in `addons/swiftly/configs/databases.json` with the key `swiftly_admins` like in the following example:
```json
{
    "swiftly_admins": {
        "hostname": "...",
        "username": "...",
        "password": "...",
        "database": "...",
        "port": 3306
    }
}
```
> [!WARNING]
> Don't forget to replace the `...` with the actual values !!
